## [4.5.4] - 2022-01-18
### Added
- Added internal support to get the part number of a PCAN hardware (a.k.a. IPEH number).
- Added translations for error PCAN_ERROR_ILLMODE.
### Changed
- Changed required size for parameter PCAN_LOG_STATUS to uint8_t
- Parameter PCAN_LOG_TEXT automatically enables PCAN_LOG_STATUS
- Corrected a bug in pcanbasic_bus_state_to_condition (ERROR_ACTIVE flag was detected as ERROR_PASSIVE)
- If a status message is read the return value of CAN_Read/CAN_ReadFD is also the error code of the status frame.
- Makefile swapped command 'cp' in install to $(INSTALL) (defined as 'install')
- French text translations were revised/corrected
### Updated
- Corrected memory leak: close log file on exit
- Fixed issue when uninitializing/initializing channel with different bitrates within a few milliseconds.
- Fixed incorrect returned value when calling parameter channel condition on a specific use-case
- Fixed CAN_SetValue with parameters PCAN_TRACE_LOCATION and PCAN_LOG_LOCATION to allow a NULL buffer of size 0.
- Improved size checks for null-terminated get/set parameters
- Normalized status code for pcanbasic_get_value_xxx functions
- Updated some returned codes (in case of errors) for every entry points to match exactly PCANBasic Windows 4.6 behaviour.

### Updated
- Fixed year in "start time" comments for .trc files.

## [4.5.1] - 2021-09-24
### Changed
- Fixed CAN_Uninitialize when Tx queue is not empty, waiting time was 50ms instead of 500ms.
- CAN_Uninitialize clears Tx queue before closing (avoiding any driver's extra waiting time)
- Fixed issue when calling CAN_Uninitialize(PCAN_NONEBUS) and continue using the API (involving parameter PCAN_AVAILABLE_CHANNELS).
- Fixed side-effects in CAN_SetValue on non-ARM systems (see previous ARM patch).
- Fixed syslog log_level
- library initialization now also initializes internal parameters 

## [4.5.0] - 2021-09-02
### Added
- Added support to new API entry point: CAN_LookUpChannel.
- Added automatic compilation of libpcanbasic 32 bit version
- Added mechanism to ignore status frame on reset (and CAN_Initialize, use definition KEEP_STATUS_FRAME_ON_RESET to disable)

- Added missing functions to handle logging of LOG_FUNCTION_READ, LOG_FUNCTION_WRITE
### Changed
- Fixed $STARTTIME in trc file to match PEAK-TRACE spec.
- Replaced uses of deprecated 'gettimeofday' with 'clock_gettime'.
- Function pcanbasic_get_device now initializes a status parameter to get same error code as on Windows.

- Factorized duplicate code with internal function pcanbasic_get_fd.
- Updated MakeFile to specify precisely exported functions (see def file).
- Fixed returned code (in case of erros) for every entry points to match exactly PCANBasic Windows behaviour.
- Given pathes are now internally converted and stored as absolute pathes (internal pathes are dynamically allocated).
- Enabling logging now checks and immediately opens the log file (same as Windows).
- CAN_Read/CAN_ReadFD and CAN_Write/CAN_WriteFD now check if the corresponding CAN_Initialize/CAN_InitializeFD was used (PCAN_ERROR_ILLOPERATION).
- CAN_Write/CAN_WriteFD now supports PCAN_ERROR_XMTFULL error code.
- Changed trace to support chronological ordering: libpcanfd msg-echoing is enabled by default (if supported, FD fw only).
- Fixed CAN_SetValue to return an error when the size of the buffer is invalid.
- Improved CAN_SetValue to better handle buffer with a size smaller than expected (ARM).
